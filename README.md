# Web-Shell

I have created a shell prompt using javascript and html which I call Web Shell. Currently there is not much to do in Web Shell but this will change as more functions are created. As the shell is created in javascript, functions are easily created and I have already created a function to import libraries.

The shell is located at http://zacmcchesney.com/Projects/Shell.
